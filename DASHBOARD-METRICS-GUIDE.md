# 📊 NVIDIA Dashboard Metrics Guide

*A comprehensive guide to understanding all dashboard metrics and what they mean for your project health*

---

## 🎯 **Dashboard Overview**

The NVIDIA Bug Dashboard provides three main perspectives on project health:

1. **📝 Issue Management & Project Health** - Current status and trends
2. **⚡ Developer Efficiency** - Team productivity and delivery metrics  
3. **🤝 Community Engagement** - External participation and collaboration

---

## 📝 **Section 1: Issue Management & Project Health**

### **Issue Overview Metrics**

| Metric | What It Measures | Good Range | Interpretation |
|--------|------------------|------------|----------------|
| **Total Issues** | All issues ever created | N/A | Higher numbers indicate active project usage |
| **Open Issues** | Currently unresolved issues | Stable or decreasing | Shows current workload |
| **Closed Issues** | Resolved issues | Increasing over time | Indicates progress and delivery |
| **Burn Rate** | % of total issues that are closed | 70-90% | Higher = better issue resolution |
| **Avg Resolution Time** | Days from creation to closure | 7-30 days | Lower = faster problem solving |
| **Recent Activity** | Issues created in last 30 days | Stable trend | Shows project momentum |

**📈 Example:** If you have 1,000 total issues with 200 open (20%) and 800 closed (80%), your burn rate is 80% - indicating good progress.

### **Weekly Activity Metrics**

| Metric | What It Measures | Healthy Pattern |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **New Issues This Week** | Issues created in last 7 days | Consistent flow |
| **Closed Issues This Week** | Issues resolved in last 7 days | Equal or greater than new issues |
| **Net Change** | New issues minus closed issues | Zero or negative (closing more than creating) |

### **Important Issues That Need Attention**

| Alert Type | Definition | Action Needed |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| **🟡 Stale Issues** | No activity for 30+ days | Review and update or close |
| **🔴 Critical Issues** | High priority labels (P0, P1, urgent, blocker) | Immediate attention required |
| **⚠️ Unassigned Critical** | High priority issues without owners | Assign responsibility |
| **📅 Overdue Issues** | Past deadline or marked as overdue | Escalate or re-prioritize |

**🚨 Red Flags:**
- More than 20% of issues are stale
- Critical issues without assignees
- Increasing trend in overdue issues

### **Issue Trends (3-Month View)**

**📊 What the charts show:**
- **Green Line (Closed)**: Issues resolved over time
- **Red Line (New)**: New issues created over time  
- **Blue Area (Total Open)**: Outstanding issue backlog

**✅ Healthy Patterns:**
- Closed issues trending upward
- New issues relatively stable
- Total open issues stable or decreasing

**⚠️ Warning Signs:**
- New issues consistently above closed issues
- Total open issues growing rapidly
- Large drops in closure rate

### **Issue Distribution**

**By Type:**
- **🐛 Bug**: Defects requiring fixes
- **✨ Enhancement**: New features or improvements
- **📚 Documentation**: Documentation updates
- **🎯 Epic**: Large features spanning multiple issues
- **📋 Task**: Maintenance work

**By Priority:**
- **🔥 P0 (Critical)**: Immediate action required
- **🟡 P1 (High)**: High priority, resolve soon
- **🟢 P2 (Medium)**: Normal priority
- **⚪ Unassigned**: No priority set (needs triage)

## ⚡ **Section 2: Developer Efficiency Metrics**

### **Core Development Metrics**

| Metric | Definition | Industry Benchmark | What Good Looks Like |
|--------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Cycle Time** | Time from PR creation to merge | 1-3 days | < 2 days for most changes |
| **Review Time** | Time waiting for PR approval | 4-24 hours | < 1 day for standard reviews |
| **PR Size** | Lines of code changed per PR | 100-300 lines | Smaller PRs merge faster |
| **Throughput** | PRs merged per week | 10-20 per team | Consistent delivery rate |
| **WIP Count** | Open PRs per developer | 1-3 per person | Avoid too much parallel work |

**📊 Developer Efficiency Performance Levels:**
- **🚀 Elite**: Cycle time < 1 day, high throughput
- **✅ High**: Cycle time 1-3 days, good throughput  
- **📊 Medium**: Cycle time 1 week, moderate throughput
- **⚠️ Low**: Cycle time > 1 week, low throughput

### **Developer Performance**

**Individual Metrics:**
- **PRs Merged**: Contribution volume (last 3 months)
- **Avg Cycle Time**: Personal efficiency rate
- **Avg Review Time**: How quickly others review their work
- **Avg PR Size**: Code change complexity
- **Open PRs**: Current active work

**🎯 Balanced Performance:**
- Moderate PR volume with good quality
- Consistent cycle times
- Reasonable PR sizes (not too large)

## 🤝 **Section 3: Community Engagement**

### **Community Health Indicators**

| Metric | What It Shows | Healthy Range | Interpretation |
|--------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Total Contributors** | Unique people who created issues | Growing over time | Expanding user base |
| **Active Contributors** | Contributors in last 30 days | 20-40% of total | Recent engagement level |
| **First-time Contributors** | New people contributing | 10-30% of active | New user adoption |
| **Avg Response Time** | Hours to first response | < 24 hours | Community responsiveness |

### **Contributor Distribution**

**Internal vs External:**
- **Internal Contributors**: NVIDIA team members
- **External Contributors**: Community members, partners
- **Healthy Mix**: 60-80% external shows strong community adoption

### **Engagement Quality**

| Metric | Calculation | Good Target |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Engagement Rate** | % of issues with community interaction | > 70% |
| **External Participation** | % of contributors who are external | > 60% |
| **Response Coverage** | % of issues that get responses | > 80% |
